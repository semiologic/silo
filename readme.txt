== Description ==

A collection of widgets to create silo web designed sites using static pages.

= This post/page in widgets =

This plugin shares options with a couple of other plugins from Semiologic. They're available when editing your posts and pages, in meta boxes called "This post in widgets" and "This page in widgets."

These options allow you to configure a title and a description that are then used by Fuzzy Widgets, Random Widgets, Related Widgets, Nav Menu Widgets, Silo Widgets, and so on. They additionally allow you to exclude a post or page from all of them in one go.
